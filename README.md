- index.html : Establishes the core HTML structure for the dual-panel layout, ensuring semantic separation of content. <br>

- style.css : Implements the full-screen layout (100vh) using Flexbox and utilizes complex CSS transitions (2s ease-in-out) to create the smooth expansion animation based on user interaction. <br>

- index.js : Manages all DOM event listeners (mouseenter and mouseleave) to dynamically apply CSS classes that trigger the visual split and expansion effect.
